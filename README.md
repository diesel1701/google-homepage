From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

Reflection time...

A painful, but needed, step to test my own understanding of how to implement html and css, basically from scratch.

Up until this point, I've been following direction and imitating what I'm told. That has been helpful, but this project showed me that I don't know everything as well as I thought. Forcing myself to push through the struggles was a great learning experience.

I definitely left some things undone, but I felt like I was letting the perfectionist in me stop my progress in the cirriculum.

A few things that have clicked or, at the very least, are a little less foggy than before:

floats - need to dig into the clearfix a bit more, though
inline-block
:hover
background-image
margin: auto

A few things to work on:

where inhertiance works and doesn't
backround-image - I know I said it's less foggy, but having the web dev browswer tool really saved me this time around
pseudo selectors - other than :hover
BEST PRACTICES - I almost let myself freeze-up because I didn't want to do something that was bad form for web dev. Need to keep learning what best practices are, but not let it stop my progress when I'm unsure
